## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics.

## By using EDA, we can understand the dataset easily, find patterns, identify outliers and explore the relationship between variables by using non-graphical and graphical techniques.

## EDA also helps us to choose which feature should be considered to use for our machine learning model. (aka feature selection)

## Now, we know that Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a very important part of a data science project to understand data and get the intuition behind each variable.

## In this post, I will be focusing on step-by-step exploratory data analysis to explain EDA smoothly and concisely.

## Letâ€™s get started!
